function J = calcJacobian_groupno(q, joint, robot)
% CALCJACOBIAN_GROUPNO Calculate the Jacobian of a particular joint of the 
%   robot in a given configuration. CHANGE GROUPNO TO YOUR GROUP NUMBER.
%
% INPUTS:
%   q     - 1 x 6 vector of joint inputs [q1,q2,q3,q4,q5,q6]
%   joint - scalar in [1,7] representing which joint we care about
%   robot - a struct of robot parameters
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   J - 6 x (joint-1) matrix representing the Jacobian
